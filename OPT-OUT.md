# How to Opt Out of Scraping

We take a conservative approach to scraping (as college students who don't want to get sued)

1. We respect robots.txt
2. We limit our scrapers to wait at least 10 seconds before making another request to any domain
3. We don't try to hide our traffic, change user agents, or otherwise evade web scraping protections

Our user agent is `user-agent` if you want to add our bot to your robots.txt file

However, if you don't want to be included in our index, don't want our scrapers hitting your infrastructure and can't change your robots.txt, or if you have any comment, questions, or concerns, feel free to contact us at [future email here]
